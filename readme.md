With this web application you can send surveys to multiple recipients. The question is boolean based so for now the recipients can reply only with yes or no. In order to send out surveys, credits need to be added first. The transaction will be approved by Stripe and credits will be added directly after the payment. Before that, you can simply login with a gmail account and of which the authorization is done by Google via oAuth. The surveys are saved in the database and remains on your account.
